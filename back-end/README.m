## **Country Searcher - Back-End Setup**

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the **Country Searcher** back-end application.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

If you haven't cloned the repository yet, begin by cloning it from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Axeellima/test-developstoday
```

### **2. Navigate to the Back-End Directory**

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the back-end folder:

```bash
cd back-end
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

In the back-end folder, install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages as specified in the `package.json` file.

### **4. Configure Your Environment**

You need to configure the `.env` file to set up the API URLs and the port for the back-end server.

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` and configure the following variables:

   - `DATE_NAGER_API`: Set this to the Date Nager API URL (for example, `https://date.nager.at/api/v3`).
   - `COUNTRIES_NOW_API`: Set this to the Countries Now API URL (for example, `https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries`).
   - `PORT`: Specify your desired port for the back-end server (e.g., 3333).

Example:

```env
DATE_NAGER_API="https://date.nager.at/api/v3"
COUNTRIES_NOW_API="https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries"
PORT=3333
```

### **5. Run the Application**

After configuring the environment, you can start the back-end server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the back-end application on your specified port (e.g., `http://localhost:3333`). The API should now be up and running.

### **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the back-end, make sure that:

1. The API URLs in `.env` are correct.
2. All dependencies are installed correctly (try running `npm install` again if needed).
3. The specified port is not in use by another application. You can change the port in `.env` if needed.

For further issues, check the terminal logs or open an issue in the GitHub repository.
